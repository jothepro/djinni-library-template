# Djinni Library

A template for a Djinni library that can be used in Java/Kotlin on Android, ObjC/Swift on iOS/macOS and C# on Windows.

## Features

* 🧞‍♂️ Develop your library once in C++, use it in Code written in Java, C++/CLI (.NET 5) or Swift thanks to [Djinni](https://djinni.xlcpp.dev/).
* 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 Can build & bundle binaries for 
  - macOS, iOS (XCFramework)
  - Android (AAR)
  - Windows .NET 5.0 (NuGet)
  - Linux
* 🎣 Dependency Management with Conan
* 🧶 Easy to use CLI to configure build output for different platforms
* 📑 Building Doxygen docs for all target languages

## How to use this template

* Create a new repository using this template.
* Make sure you understand how to use it in your project & how to build & run for development before you change something.
* Search for all occurrences of "MyDjinniLibrary", "DjinniLibrary", "My" in the project to replace all occurrences of the
  template target and/or namespaces. You can ignore anything inside `lib/djinni-generated`, as it will be updated by 
  Djinni automatically.

## Installation

This template integrates into each build system by providing a package format native to each platform.

![Packages overview](docs/img/packages_overview.drawio.svg)

### Android

1. Add the repository to your project
   ```groovy
   repositories {
       maven {
           url "https://maven.pkg.github.com/jothepro/djinni-library-template"
       }
   }
   ```
2. Add the package dependencies to your applications build.gradle file:
   ```groovy
   dependencies {
       implementation 'my.djinnilibrary:mydjinnilibrary'
   }
   ```

### Visual Studio 2019 (Windows)

*The NuGet package only works for .NET 5 (Core) Projects!*

1. [Add the Package Source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-visual-studio#package-sources).
   ```
   https://nuget.pkg.github.com/jothepro/index.json
   ```
2. In the NuGet Package Manager search for `MyDjinniLibrary` and install the package.


### XCode (macOS, iOS)

1. Add the repository [`jothepro/djinni-library-template-swiftpackage`](https://github.com/jothepro/djinni-library-template-swiftpackage) 
   as Package dependency to your XCode project.
   It contains the XCFramework with the Objective-C binaries.
2. [Add a bridging header](https://riptutorial.com/ios/example/32537/how-to-create-a-swift-bridging-header-manually) to your project.
3. Add this import to the bridging header:
    ```objective-c
    #import <MyDjinniLibrary/MyDjinniLibrary.h>
    ```
   
### Linux

*This template is meant to be used in a C++ project on Linux, e.g. together with `gtkmm-3.0`.
The binary for Linux consists of just the C++ interface without any wrapper.*

1. Add the conan remote.
   ```bash
   conan remote add djinni_library_template https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/27897297/packages/conan
   ```
2. Add the library as dependency in your conanfile.
   ```ini
   [requires]
   my_djinni_library/0.0.1@jothepro/release
   ```

- [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) >= 2.47.3

#### Android (Java)

- Android NDK

- [Nuget CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/install-nuget-client-tools#nugetexe-cli) >= 5.9
- [Visual Studio 16 2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/windows/?view=vs-2019)
  * .NET 5.0 Runtime
  * .NET SDK

### Build

#### Pure C++ build

During development, building the C++-Code and running tests can be done as usual in a C++ project with Conan:

* **Commandline:**
  ```bash 
  # check out all submodules
  git submodule update --init
  # Install Dependencies with Conan
  conan install --install-folder=build .
  # Configure, Build & Test
  conan build --build-folder=build .
   ```
* **Clion:** Install the [Conan Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11956-conan) before configuring & building the project as usual.

#### Building for use in another Language

The `build.py` CLI helps you to easily build & package the library for usage in another language, without having to know
what is going on under the hood.

For details on what the various parameters of the CLI do, please consult `./build.py --help`.

All build outputs generated by `build.py` will be written to `./build/` by default. 
You can overwrite the build directory with the `--build-directory` parameter.

Before running `build.py` for the first time, install the Python dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r build_tools/djinni_build/requirements.txt
```

##### Building an Android AAR

When building for Android, Java 11 is required.
In addition to that you need to provide the NDK that you want to build with as environment variable `ANDROID_NDK_HOME`.
```bash
export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/path/to/your/ndk/22.0.6917172
./build.py --android x86 armv8 --package aar
```

This results in an Android Library (AAR) that contains both the Java-Gluecode required to call the native Library
and the binaries for both `x86` (for the emulator) & `arm64-v8a` (for the real hardware) architectures.

##### Building an XCFramework for iOS/macOS

All binaries for iOS/macOS will be combined into one big XCFramework, for easy referencing in
any Swift/Objective-C project. Note that for iOS two different platforms need to be targeted: The simulator
and the real iPhone hardware:

```bash
./build.py --iphoneos armv8 --iphonesimulator x86_64 armv8 --macos x86_64 armv8 --package xcframework
```

This results in an XCFramework that contains binaries for

* real iPhones (iOS)
* the iPhone Simulator (iOS) for both Intel & Apple silicon (ARM) architectures.
* macOS for both Intel & Apple silicon (ARM) architectures.

##### Building a .NET 5 NuGet package

```bash
./build.py --windows x86_64 x86 armv8 --package nuget
```

This results in a NuGet package that contains binaries for 3 different architectures (`x86_64`, `x86` and `arm64`).
The NuGet package makes it easy for you to include the library in a .NET 5 project without having to worry about
what `dll` to include for which architecture in the build process.

**Attention**: If you encounter the following error message when building a project that references the NuGet package, don't panic!
> Error MSB3270 There was a mismatch between the processor architecture of the project being built "x86" and the processor architecture of the reference "MyDjinniLibrary", "AMD64". This mismatch may cause runtime failures. Please consider changing the targeted processor architecture of your project through the Configuration Manager so as to align the processor architectures between your project and references, or take a dependency on references with a processor architecture that matches the targeted processor architecture of your project.

You can just ignore it, it's a false positive! The NuGet package comes with logic that will indeed package the right `dll` 
during build time. Disable the warning in the projects `.csproj` file by adding:
```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <ResolveAssemblyWarnOrErrorOnTargetArchitectureMismatch>
       None
    </ResolveAssemblyWarnOrErrorOnTargetArchitectureMismatch>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

### Test

The library comes preconfigured for Unit-Testing with Catch2:

* **Commandline:** To run just the unit-tests, you can run `conan build --build-folder=build --test .`.
* **CLion:** Execute the `MyDjinniLibraryTest` target.

### Documentation

The repository comes with 4 different Doxygen configurations, each is for a different target language:
- `Doxyfile-Cpp`: Documents the C++ interfaces that will be exposed for all the languages. They can also be used 
  directly in a C++ project, e.g. for targeting Linux with `gtkmm`.
- `Doxyfile-CppCli`: Documents the C++/CLI gluecode for targeting Windows .NET 5
- `Doxyfile-Java`: Documents the Java gluecode for targeting Android
- `Doxyfile-ObjC`: Documents the Objective-C gluecode for targeting iOS/macOS

All Doxyfiles depend on code generated by Djinni.
Make sure that the required files are present, before running Doxygen:

```bash
doxygen Doxyfile-Cpp
doxygen Doxyfile-CppCli
doxygen Doxyfile-Java
doxygen Doxyfile-ObjC
```

The resulting documentation can be found under `docs/generated/html`.
