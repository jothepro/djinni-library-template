# Djinni Library

A template for a Djinni library that can be used in Java/Kotlin on Android, ObjC/Swift on iOS/macOS and C# on Windows.

## Features

* 🧞‍♂️ Develop your library once in C++, use it in Code written in Java, C++/CLI (.NET 5) or Swift thanks to [Djinni](https://djinni.xlcpp.dev/).
* 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 Can build & bundle binaries for 
  - macOS, iOS (XCFramework)
  - Android (AAR)
  - Windows .NET 5.0 (NuGet)
  - Linux
* 🎣 Dependency Management with Conan
* 🧶 Easy to use CLI to configure build output for different platforms
* 📑 Building Doxygen docs for all target languages

## How to use this template

* Create a new repository using this template.
* Make sure you understand how to use it in your project & how to build & run for development before you change something.
* Search for all occurrences of "MyDjinniLibrary", "DjinniLibrary", "My" in the project to replace all ocurrences of the
  template target and/or namespaces. You can ignore anything inside `lib/djinni-generated`, as it will be updated by Djinni automatically.

  * .NET 5.0 Runtime
  * .NET SDK

### Build

#### Pure C++ build

During development, building the C++-Code and running tests can be done as usual in a C++ project with Conan:

* **Commandline:**
  ```bash 
   # Create build folder for out-of-source build
  mkdir build && cd build
  # Install Dependencies with Conan
  conan install ..
  # Configure, Build & Test
  conan build ..
   ```
* **Clion:** Install the [Conan Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11956-conan) before configuring & building the project as usual.

#### Building for use in another Language

The `build.py` CLI helps you to easily build & package the library for usage in another language, without having to know
what is going on under the hood.

For details on what the various parameters of the CLI do, please consult `./build.py --help`.

All build outputs generated by `build.py` will be written to `./build/` by default. 
You can overwrite the build directory with the `--build-directory` parameter.

Before running `build.py` for the first time, install the Python dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

##### Building an Android AAR

When building for Android, both a Java 11 & Java 8 SDK installation is required.
This is due to the fact that the gradle plugin for building an AAR requires Java 11, 
while the Library itself needs to be built for Java 8 in order to work with a Android Project.
  
In addition to that you need to provide the NDK that you want to build with.
```bash
./build.py --android x86_64 armv8 --aar --android-ndk /path/to/your/ndk/22.0.6917172 --java-11-home /path/to/java/11/Home --java-8-home /path/to/java/8/Home
```

This results in an Android Library (AAR) that contains both the Java-Gluecode required to call the native Library
and the binaries for both `x86_64` (for the emulator) & `arm64-v8a` (for the real hardware) architectures.

##### Building an XCFramework for iOS/macOS

All binaries for iOS/macOS will be combined into one big XCFramework, for easy referencing in
any Swift/Objective-C project. Note that for iOS two different platforms need to be targeted: The simulator
and the real iPhone hardware:

```bash
./build.py --iphoneos armv8 --iphonesimulator x86_64 armv8 --macos x86_64 armv8 --xcframework
```

This results in an XCFramework that contains binaries for

* real iPhones (iOS)
* the iPhone Simulator (iOS) for both Intel & Apple silicon (ARM) architectures.
* macOS for both Intel & Apple silicon (ARM) architectures.

##### Building a .NET 5 NuGet package

```bash
./build.py --windows x86_64 x86 armv8 --nuget
```

This results in a NuGet package that contains binaries for 3 different architectures (`x86_64`, `x86` and `arm64`).
The NuGet package makes it easy for you to include the library in a .NET 5 project without having to worry about
what `dll` to include for which architecture in the build process.

**Attention**: If you encounter the following error message when building a project that references the NuGet package, don't panic!
> Error MSB3270 There was a mismatch between the processor architecture of the project being built "x86" and the processor architecture of the reference "MyDjinniLibrary", "AMD64". This mismatch may cause runtime failures. Please consider changing the targeted processor architecture of your project through the Configuration Manager so as to align the processor architectures between your project and references, or take a dependency on references with a processor architecture that matches the targeted processor architecture of your project.

You can just ignore it, it's a false positive! The NuGet package comes with logic that will indeed package the right `dll` 
during build time. Disable the warning in the projects `.csproj` file by adding:
```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <ResolveAssemblyWarnOrErrorOnTargetArchitectureMismatch>
       None
    </ResolveAssemblyWarnOrErrorOnTargetArchitectureMismatch>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

### Test

The library comes preconfigured for Unit-Testing with Catch2:

* **Commandline:** To run just the unit-tests, you can run `conan build .. --test`.
* **CLion:** Execute the `MyDjinniLibraryTest` target

### Documentation

The repository comes with 4 different doxygen configurations, each is for a different target language:
- `Doxyfile-Cpp`: Documents the C++ interfaces that will be exposed for all the languages. They can also be used 
  directly in a C++ project, e.g. for targeting Linux with `gtkmm`.
- `Doxyfile-CppCli`: Documents the C++/CLI gluecode for targeting Windows .NET 5
- `Doxyfile-Java`: Documents the Java gluecode for targeting Android
- `Doxyfile-ObjC`: Documents the Objective-C gluecode for targeting iOS/macOS

All Doxyfiles depend on code generated by Djinni, located in `lib/djinni-generated`.
To ensure that the required files are present, the best way to generate the docs is with the 
`build.py` CLI when building for a specific platform anyways with the `--render-docs` parameter:
```bash
# This will generate the docs for C++, Java & Objective-C
./build.py --render-docs --android x86_64 --macos x86_64 
```

The resulting documentation can be found under `docs/generated/html`.
